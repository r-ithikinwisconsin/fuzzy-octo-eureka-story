Clubs in the late 70's were very different from what one might expect. Punks,
 all dressed in clothes that could best be described as "in your face", 
dancing to music that was loud, but simple. 'Joy Division' had just finished 
their set, but it was like nothing you'd heard before. The agression was
replaced with resignation, but the power stayed the same. Rob, was astounded.
He knew the music industry, he was a DJ, a compulsive note taker, and kept up 
with the charts. As the last note rung out, he knew, he had to manage the 
band.
