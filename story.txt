Clubs in the late 70's were very different from what one might expect. Punks,
 all dressed in clothes that could best be described as "in your face", 
dancing to music that was loud, but simple. 'Joy Division' had just finished 
their set, but it was like nothing you'd heard before. The agression was
replaced with resignation, but the power stayed the same. Rob, was astounded.
He knew the music industry, he was a DJ, a compulsive note taker, and kept up 
with the charts. As the last note rung out, he knew, he had to manage the 
band.

And then something cuuuhrazy happened!

It was the most crazy thing to ever happen in Rob's entire life. He was
very suprised!

He was given control of the band. Once in charge, Rob found great venues for 
Joy Division, and their music took off. Soon they were rising in the charts. 
After an awe-inspiring performance in the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville,
Tennessee, Joy Division reached #1 on the charts. 

Joy Divison and Rob toured the world, playing at other amazing avenues, their
album "Closer" reached number #1 on the USA billboard charts, and their single
"Love Will Tear Us Apart" became a staple on greatest hits of the 80's playlists.
Years after Rob had passed away, the member of Joy Division all agreed it would 
never have been possible without him.
